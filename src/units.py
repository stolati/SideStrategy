# This is more informations about gameplay


# sky => fast, visible, visibility, fragile
# earth => slow, unvisible, no-visibility, solid
# ground => mix between them, more damages
# water => limited, 



# humains (everything is round and can be anything)
# build element that can change into anything
# there is a basic element, and we can build them with addons
# so it can fly, go underground or whatewer
# when they are building, we can choose which part to add, and it give a cost
# It's slow to begin, but their elements can be devastating once enough technology have been developped.

# it feed on eath elements and eletricity (ho to get them)



# magiciens (with dinosaurs !!!)
## - instead of technology, it's spell learned
# the kind of dinausor give the ability (flying, underground or ground) 
# Spell : magic missile, teleportation

# Dinausor can feed on other dinausor to get better power/mana/life
# or resplendish their live (multiples dinosaure)


# plants (grow)
# the mothership is a growing tree and get the energy from the floor (more place is better)
# we can use energy to expand the roots.
# Put seed on the floor that can become other things.

# In other words, terran, zerg and protos, yes, my strategy game culture is limited to that

# magicians can flood the map with dinosaurs which are not agressive
# then they can use them to move around (calling the nearest for help)
# a user can be actively agressive to them, but it will take them some time/energy to do so
# do we want to do it or not ? (once attacted, the dinausors are agressive)
