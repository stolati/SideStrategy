Priority 1

- Change units into Widgets (create/destroy the ones not visible)
- Moving around another way (instead of moving by event, put a timer)
- Moving faster the closer we are from the border

- bigger than 1x1 elements (so we can go to )


Priority 2

- Optimize the map (don't create so much elements)


Priority 3

- we should avoid beiing to near the sky-floor limit for flyers and diggers
